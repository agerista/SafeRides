Mission

Women's Safety in many countries is an issue and using new and upcoming ride services is a challenge especially during later hours in the day. We aim to create an app that can provide additional information to the riders so they can choose to be safer.

Vision 


To create an app that has an extra set of parameters for women to check for safety while they leverage ride share apps. Although it does not seem like a big issue here in the US, there have been cases reported by users of these apps overseas which questions the safety of new and upcoming apps. This makes late night rides especially tricky for women and hinders both professional and social well being.



Execution

This is a social responsibility app that can be used alongside already existing ride apps.

The app would provide search capabilities on a driver with several key pieces of information that helps women filter out or know which drivers to   definitely trust. The parameters we currently chose are centered around safety ratings like the green star rating which tells whether or not the driver participated in the background checks and cleared it.The rider can choose to consider various ratings provided on the search results page to decide whether or not they want to ride with that particular driver.

Enhancements:

One useful enhancement to this app will be adding an emergency button to the app to be used while on the ride.
 
Another would be maintaining ride history for every user by proving a login feature so that riders maintain a list of trusted drivers.
