3,5,1,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,2,TRUE,I would rather put money into the pockets of the cab drivers. They often use their job as their sole means of earning a living. They also know where locations are and are. They are quick professional and (usually) do not sexually harass me when I am just trying to get to work. Lyft drivers end up using their apps to locate you and these maps tell them to go to strange and  unsafe areas of the city.

Since my address is not that street and I do not live in a tent it is his fault he doesn't know where to drive.

6,8,3,2,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,2,TRUE,my driver was on time and a very friendly woman. We drive a few blocks and she asks my destination which seemed weird since I entered it in the app. I said San Francisco and she says sorry. I can't take you there. I don't have a permit to drive there. And she pulls over to let me out.
